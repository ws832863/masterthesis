abstract = {Although volatility clustering has a long history as a salient empirical regularity characterizing high-frequency speculative prices, it was not until recently that applied researchers in finance have recognized the importance of explicitly modeling time-varying second-order moments. Instrumental in most of these empirical studies has been the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model introduced by Engle (1982). This paper contains an overview of some of the developments in the formulation of ARCH models and a survey of the numerous empirical applications using financial data. Several suggestions for future research, including the implementation and tests of competing asset pricing theories, market microstructure models, information transmission mechanisms, dynamic hedging strategies, and the pricing of derivative assets, are also discussed.},

abstract = {A ‘long memory’ property of stock market returns is investigated in this paper. It is found that not only there is substantially more correlation between absolute returns than returns themselves, but the power transformation of the absolute return also has quite high autocorrel- ation for long lags. It is possible to characterize to be ‘long memory’ and this property is strongest when d is around 1. This result appears to argue against ARCH type specifications based upon squared returns. But our Monte-Carlo study shows that both ARCH type models based on squared returns and those based on absolute return can produce this property. A new general class of models is proposed which allows the power delta of the heteroskedasticity equation to be estimated from the data.},

abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

The computer and the development of interactive graphics programs have made curve estimation possible. This volume focuses on the applications and practical problems of two central aspects of curve smoothing - the choice of smoothing parameters and the construction of confidence bounds. H\"{a}rdle argues that all smoothing methods are based on a local averaging mechanism and can be seen as essentially equivalent to kernel smoothing. To simplify the exposition, kernel smoothers are introduced and discussed in great detail. Building on this exposition, various other smoothing methods (among them splines and orthogonal polynomials) are presented and their merits discussed. All the methods presented can be understood on an intuitive level; however, exercises and supplemental materials are provided for those readers desiring a deeper understanding of the techniques. The methods covered in this text have numerous applications in many areas using statistical analysis. Examples are drawn from economics as well as from other disciplines including medicine and engineering.},

These results are supported by the use of robust loss functions and the Hansen's (2005) superior predictive ability test.

Via Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that maximum-likelihood estimators are essentially unbiased, provided the size of subsamples is correctly chosen, and that the likelihood-ratio tests on parameters characterizing the behavior of extremes are correctly sized. For actual returns, we find that left and right tails behave very similarly. Across countries, we find that extremes are located at different levels and that their dispersion varies. The tail index, characterizing large extreme realizations, is found to be constant within each geographical group. We verify that the perception that left tails are heavier than right ones is not due to clustering of extremes. The failure to detect statistical significant differences is likely to be due to the relative infrequency of large extremes. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the behavior of stock return volatility using daily data from 1885 through 1987. The October 1987 stock market crash was unusual in many ways relative to prior history. In particular, stock volatility jumped dramatically during and after the crash, but it returned to lower. more normal levels quickly. I use data on implied volatilities from call option prices and estimates of volatility from futures contracts on stock indexes to confirm this result.},

abstract = {In this paper we derive a semiparametric efficient adaptive estimator of an asymmetric GARCH model. Applying some general results from Drost et al. [1997. The Annals of Statistics 25, 786-818], we first estimate the unknown density function of the disturbances by kernel methods, then apply a one-step Newton-Raphson method to obtain a more efficient estimator than the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator. The proposed semiparametric estimator is adaptive for parameters appearing in the conditional standard deviation model with respect to the unknown distribution of the disturbances. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{XinzhongXuandStephenJ.Taylor1994,
abstract = {This paper illustrates regression and Kalman filtering methods for estimating the time- varying term structure of volatility expectations revealed by options prices. Short- and long-term expectations are estimated for four currencies using daily PHLX options prices from 1985 to 1989. Throughout this period, there were important differences between short- and long-term expectations. The slope of the term structure changed frequently and there were significant variations in long-term volatility expectations. The expectation estimates can be used to value OTC options, to improve hedging strategies, and to test the hypothesis that the options market overreacts.
